Many sports analysis have tried to find a different correlation betweening being a successful winning team, average team, and a losing 
team. As of right now, the only strong correlation between these is how many goals are scored. This begs the question:

**If goals scored is the strongest indicator of team status, then is there locations on the ice that determine a teams strongest scoring position?**

To answer this, the location of goal data will need to be collected from every team in the NHL, along with the location from 
where the goal was scored. Then a cluster model will be created to determine:

- Goal scoring zones
- Goal scoring zones percentage
- Goal vs shots percentages
- Goals scored vs goals blocked by opposing team

Kmeans clustering method will also be used to determine how many sections there are on the ice and what is there composition of play.
